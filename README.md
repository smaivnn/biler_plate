# Hi there.
This is a basic login boiler plate using react+reduxToolKit+nodejs+passport+mongoDB. 
I'm not good enough, but I hope you use it well.

I saw the opinion that redux async thunk is inefficient.
if use thunk, Rudux tends to play an asynchronous communication role rather than a store.
So, some opinion said that they use redux for client state and react-query for server state.
Try to note that there is such an opinion. I don't know much about this, so I'll check it out.

# To use this application, 
1. type "npm install" inside both "client" and "server" folder 
2. make .env file in server folder and put your
  "DATABASE_URI" : mongoDB connect url.
  "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET" : secret key for accessToken
  "REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET" : secret key for refreshToken

# Notice
If there is an error or a better correction, please tell me. i will fix it.

Thank you.
